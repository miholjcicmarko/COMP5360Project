    "Currently the world is facing a global pandemic with a new virus that has evolved and crossed over to humans. The virus known as COVID-19 affects the respiratory and cardiovascular systems by binding to the Ace-2 receptors. Ace-2 receptors are found widespread through the cardiovascular and respiratory system, for this reason the virus is extremely dangerous for susceptible populations. Currently, 30% of Americans suffer from cardiovascular diseases, 10% diabetus, and 10% asthma; these populations dont even account for those who are immunocompromised or more susceptible for other reasons. \n",
    "The virus causes violent coughing, restricted breathing, inflammation, and cardiovascular hypertension (among other cardiovascular effects). Further, it can cause pneumonia. Combined with the complications caused by the virus, pneumonia is can be fatal; especially if left untreated. \n",
    "Due to how transmissible the virus is, hospitals and healthcare workers across the world have been put to the test. The rapid spread of the virus has caused many hospitals to become overloaded with patients, with limited resources available. \n",
    "\n",
    "To try and curb the spread of the virus, places across the world are temporarily shutting down and countries have been recommended to social quarentine, or have gone into a full lockdown. Ripple effects have been detrimental to the economy. Millions of people have lost their jobs. People are dipping into their savings to pay rent, or worse, they can't pay rent. Some have even speculated an economic recession after the virus passes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This virus shows just how ill equipt the United States and the entire world are for pandemics and biological warfare that may present itself in the future. Hopefully this can be a learning experience for every nation, if nothing else. "

    "Understand the severity of the global pandemic and visualize the effects to come in the near future when it's at its worst in the United States. Using predictive modeling techniques such as logistic regression and classification models, we will identify how long until the number of cases begins to plateau, how many cases there will be when it begins to plateau, and a prediction of the number of deaths a location will experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the predictive models to create plots to visualize the severity of the virus in the locations analyzed. Further, we will explore which states will be most heavily impacted. A geospatial map will be created to plot the spread of COVID-19 in the United States and identify the hospital beds per 1,000 for each state."

These variables will provide for a more robust classification model to predict the severity of impact the virus will have on every state. \n",
